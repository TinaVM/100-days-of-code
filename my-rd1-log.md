Day 1 : June 18, 2022

Today's Progress: Started the Cat Photo App Actitvy on freecodecamp.org in the Responsive Web Design Course and stopped at Step 36.

Thoughts: I decided to start from the basics and eventually build on until I reach the Responsive Web Design topics as that is what I have a challenge with.
I would have loved to complete the whole Activity but I was pressed for time for other commitments. Hope to keep up the pace for the next day as today I have only coded for an hour.

Day 2: June 19, 2022

Today's Progress: Completed the Cat Photo App activity on freecodecamp.org in the Responsive Web Design Course. Also did 1 codewars challenge and hoping to complete 2 challenges the next day!

Thoughts: The Cat Photo App Activity refreshened some of the basic html elements that I had learnt earlier in my schooling days. I enjoyed completing each step. The codewars challenge was a bit tricky as I had approached the challenge in a different way as opposed to other peoplewho completed it but later on figured it out. After completing the challenge, I realised that I have to go over some concepts to refreshen my skills.

Day 3: June 20, 2022

Today's Progress: Started the 'Building a Cafe Menu' project in the responsive web design course of freecodecamp.org. I also completed 2 codewars challenges.

Thoughts: The Cafe Menu peoject gave me some insight to the responsiveness of CSS, I'm hoping to push further in the activity and focus on the parts that can help me solve my issues with responsiveness. The codewars that I completed today were abit challenging even though the activities sounded easy. I will not give up!

Day 5: July 20, 2022

Today's Progress: Started the 'Learn Colors By Building a Set of Colored Markers' project in freecodecamp.org of the responsive web design course and stopped at step 53. Also started the 'Basic JavaScript' chapter of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures of freecodecamp.org and stopped at part 9.

Thoughts: I have learnt about the different color models and what a mixture of them does when trying to create different gradients to a specific div container. I have also learnt today the basic JavaScript syntax and structure. I look forward to learning and completing both courses.

Day 6: July 21, 2022

Today's Progress: Completed the 'Learn Colors By Building a Set of Colored Markers' project in freecodecamp.org of the responsive web design course. Also learnt some compund assignments with JavaScript.

Thoughts: After the completion, I have learnt more about the color models and how the different color models' values affect an object and its color. With JavaScript, the topics that I have learnt today is not something that I am new to, so learning the concept of compound assignments was rather easy for me to understand as other programming languages also use this concept.
