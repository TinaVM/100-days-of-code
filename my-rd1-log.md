Day 1 : June 18, 2022

Today's Progress: Started the Cat Photo App Actitvy on freecodecamp.org in the Responsive Web Design Course and stopped at Step 36.

Thoughts: I decided to start from the basics and eventually build on until I reach the Responsive Web Design topics as that is what I have a challenge with.
I would have loved to complete the whole Activity but I was pressed for time for other commitments. Hope to keep up the pace for the next day as today I have only coded for an hour.
