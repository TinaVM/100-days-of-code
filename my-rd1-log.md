Day 1 : June 18, 2022

Today's Progress: Started the Cat Photo App Actitvy on freecodecamp.org in the Responsive Web Design Course and stopped at Step 36.

Thoughts: I decided to start from the basics and eventually build on until I reach the Responsive Web Design topics as that is what I have a challenge with.
I would have loved to complete the whole Activity but I was pressed for time for other commitments. Hope to keep up the pace for the next day as today I have only coded for an hour.

Day 2: June 19, 2022

Today's Progress: Completed the Cat Photo App activity on freecodecamp.org in the Responsive Web Design Course. Also did 1 codewars challenge and hoping to complete 2 challenges the next day!

Thoughts: The Cat Phot App Activity refreshened some of the basic html elements that I had learnt earlier in my schooling days. I enjoyed completing each step. The codewars challenge was a bit tricky as I had approached the challenge in a different way as opposed to other peoplewho completed it but later on figured it out. After completing the challenge, I realised that I have to go over some concepts to refreshen my skills.

Link to work: Complete. Reference to work unavailable as freecodecamp does not provide any link to download activites completed.
