Day 1 : June 18, 2022

Today's Progress: Started the Cat Photo App Actitvy on freecodecamp.org in the Responsive Web Design Course and stopped at Step 36.

Thoughts: I decided to start from the basics and eventually build on until I reach the Responsive Web Design topics as that is what I have a challenge with.
I would have loved to complete the whole Activity but I was pressed for time for other commitments. Hope to keep up the pace for the next day as today I have only coded for an hour.

Day 2: June 19, 2022

Today's Progress: Completed the Cat Photo App activity on freecodecamp.org in the Responsive Web Design Course. Also did 1 codewars challenge and hoping to complete 2 challenges the next day!

Thoughts: The Cat Photo App Activity refreshened some of the basic html elements that I had learnt earlier in my schooling days. I enjoyed completing each step. The codewars challenge was a bit tricky as I had approached the challenge in a different way as opposed to other peoplewho completed it but later on figured it out. After completing the challenge, I realised that I have to go over some concepts to refreshen my skills.

Day 3: June 20, 2022

Today's Progress: Started the 'Building a Cafe Menu' project in the responsive web design course of freecodecamp.org. I also completed 2 codewars challenges.

Thoughts: The Cafe Menu peoject gave me some insight to the responsiveness of CSS, I'm hoping to push further in the activity and focus on the parts that can help me solve my issues with responsiveness. The codewars that I completed today were abit challenging even though the activities sounded easy. I will not give up!
